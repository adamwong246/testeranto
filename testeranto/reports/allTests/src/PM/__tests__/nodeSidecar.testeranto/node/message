Fix the failing tests described in testeranto/reports/allTests/src/PM/__tests__/nodeSidecar.testeranto/node/tests.json and testeranto/reports/allTests/src/PM/__tests__/nodeSidecar.testeranto/node/console_log.txt. DO NOT refactor beyond what is necessary. Always prefer minimal changes, focusing mostly on keeping the BDD tests passing
