# Chache's feedback

navbar made sense when pointed out but user did not notice the bar at all at startup. User was hesitant to click because icons purpose was unclear. User wants "non-scary" names, like "eddy" and "procman" rather than "editor" or "process manager".

# dislike

- not clear what user should do.

# likes

- fun esperanto names
