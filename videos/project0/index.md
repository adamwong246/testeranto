**Animation Principles:**

1. **60fps smooth animations** using Motion Canvas's renderer
2. **Audio-synced visuals** via timeline markers
3. **Responsive design** works at any resolution
4. **Modular scenes** with reusable components

## Storyboard

### Scene 1: The Problem

**Voiceover**:  
"Large Language Models have changed the game forever. It's never been easier to generate code, but it's also never been harder to know if your code is as robust as ChatGpt would lead you to believe. Sure, you can scaffold out a react app from scratch with 1 prompt... but can you vibe your way around a real-world codebase? What do you do when your app no longer fits in the context window? What do you do when you are out of api credits? And are you sure that the LLM is not hallucinating?"

**Animation**:

- [0-3s] Code explosion with colorful files (App.tsx, index.html etc.) bursting from center
- [3-6s] Context window (semi-transparent rectangle) shrinks while code overflows
- [6-9s] API credit counter (top-right) drains from 100% to 0% with warning glow
- [9-12s] Thought bubble appears with "Hallucination?" and question mark particles
- [12-18s] All elements compress into a tangled knot of code wires

### Scene 2: Testeranto Introduction

**Voiceover**:  
"Introducing testeranto, the AI-powered BDD test framework for typescript projects. It's a fresh new way of testing typescript code, one that harnesses the raw power of LLM generated code with the control of Behavior Driven Design."

**Animation**:

- [0-2s] Logo assembles from the tangled code wires (morphing animation)
- [2-4s] BDD keywords (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN) orbit the logo in colored circles
- [4-6s] "AI-Powered" badge pulses with circuit board pattern
- [6-8s] Code samples reformat into clean, organized structure

### Scene 3: How It Works

**Voiceover**:  
"Here how it works: you wrap your code in a 'semantic layer' that exposes it to the gherkin like directives Given, When and Then. Then, you add some behavior specs, written in a strongly typed DSL that even a stakeholder can understand. Testeranto will bundle and execute your test on it's custom multi-platform environment- that means it can run tests in the browser, as well as on the server-side- and the results of those tests, along with your source code, your documentation and your feature specifications are all gathered into a precisely tuned prompt, which you can load into the context of any LLM. With the press of a button, testeranto will launch that prompt, and auto-magically fix the broken tests."

**Animation**:

- [0-3s] Code gets wrapped in glowing semantic layer (concentric circles)
- [3-6s] Gherkin editor slides in with sample test specs typing automatically
- [6-9s] Environment switcher flips between browser/node/pure JS icons
- [9-12s] Prompt construction visualized as stacking LEGO blocks
- [12-15s] "Fix Tests" button presses itself with magic sparkle effect

### Scene 4: Living Documentation

**Voiceover**:  
"Testeranto is more than a test platform- it's living documentation and a test reporter too. All the data that is fed into the LLM context is also used to build a static website, which is easily deployed to github pages. The puts the BDD specs, the test results and the test artifacts in 1 convenient package, allowing you to know the health of your codebase at a glance."

**Animation**:

- [0-3s] Website generator machine assembling documentation
- [3-6s] Health dashboard with:
  - Test pass/fail meter filling
  - Coverage dial spinning to 95%+
  - Performance graph trending upward
- [6-9s] GitHub pages deployment animation (rocket launch)

### Sceneiun 5: Call to Action

**Voiceover**:  
"Do you think that your project could benefit from testeranto. Then contact testeranto-dev@gmail.com to get put to the front of the list for our beta program and get free support for life."

**Animation**:

- [0-2s] Terminal typing "npm install testeranto@beta" with cursor blink
- [2-4s] Email button pulses with envelope icon
- [4-6s] "Beta" badge bounces in with golden glow
- [6-8s] All elements align into final product shot
