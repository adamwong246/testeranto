**Animation Principles:**

1. **60fps smooth animations** using requestAnimationFrame
2. **Audio-synced visuals** via Revision's timeline
3. **Responsive design** works at any size
4. **Modular scenes** for easy updates

**Storyboard:** (see previous frames)

### Scene 1: The Problem (0:00-0:20)

**Frame 1:**

- Developer at desk with multiple monitors
- Red test failure notifications piling up
- Clock showing hours passing
  **Text:** "AI has changed the game forever. It's never been easier to generate code, but it's also never been harder to know if your code is as robust as ChatGpt would lead you to believe. Sure, you can scaffold out a react app from scratch with 1 prompt... but can you vibe your way around a real-world codebase?" What do you do when your app no longer fits in the context window? What do you do when you are out of api credits? And are you sure that the LLM is not hallucinating?

**Frame 2:**

- Zoom into LLM window
- Hundreds of files loading with only 2-3 relevant
- Context window overflowing
  **Text:** "Testeranto pus the reins on AI, harnessing the raw power of LLM generated code with the control of Behavior Driven Testing, or BDD. By generating prompts with finely tuned contexts, Testeranto can fix failing tests with the press of a button, allowing you to get better results out of cheaper models"

### Scene 2: Testeranto's Solution (0:20-0:35)

**Frame 3:**

- Test failures form Testeranto logo
- Blue light pulse effect
  **Text:** "Did I mention that you can use any model you like? Testeranto makes it easy to use any LLM you like. With OpenRouter, you can even run your own model- no more api credits to pay for!"

**Frame 4:**

- Esbuild dependency graph visualization
- Files lighting up as they're analyzed
- Relevant files being selected
  **Text:** "Testeranto uses industry standard BDD methodologies to ensure your code does what it says it does. Define your tests in a gherkin-like DSL so simple, even a stakeholder can use it. "

### Scene 3: Context Optimization (0:35-0:55)

**Frame 5:**

- Split screen comparison:
  Left: Messy traditional AI context
  Right: Clean Testeranto selection
  **Text:** "Only what's needed"

**Frame 6:**

- AI fixing animation:
  1. Red test failure
  2. Relevant files highlight
  3. Green check appears
     **Text:** "Precision fixes"

### Scene 4: Cross-Runtime Demo (0:55-1:10)

**Frame 7:**

- Single test running in 3 environments:
  1. Node terminal
  2. Browser window
  3. Pure JS sandbox
     **Text:** "Write once, run anywhere"

**Frame 8:**

- Type safety shield animation:
  - Red errors hitting shield
  - Shield glowing blue
    **Text:** "Type-safe across runtimes"

### Scene 5: Call to Action (1:10-1:30)

**Frame 9:**

- Developer smiling, tests passing
- Terminal with commands:
  `npm install testeranto@beta`
  `yarn t-init`
  **Text:** "Get started in seconds"

**Frame 10:**

- GitHub star button pulsing
- Counter showing stars increasing
  **Text:** "Join the beta today"

**End Screen:**

- Testeranto logo center
- Tagline: "AI-powered testing with laser focus"
- GitHub URL below
- Animated "Star & Try" button
