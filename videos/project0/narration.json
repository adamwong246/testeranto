  "problem": "Large Language Models have changed the game forever. It's never been easier to generate code, but it's also never been harder to know if your code is as robust as ChatGpt would lead you to believe. Sure, you can scaffold out a react app from scratch with 1 prompt... but can you vibe your way around a real-world codebase? What do you do when your app no longer fits in the context window? What do you do when you are out of api credits? And are you sure that the LLM is not hallucinating?",
  "solution": "Introducing testeranto, the AI-powered BDD test framework for typescript projects. It's a fresh new way of testing typescript code, one that harnesses the raw power of LLM generated code with the control of Behavior Driven Design.",
  "how_it_works": "Here how it works: you wrap your code in a 'semantic layer' that exposes it to the gherkin like directives Given, When and Then. Then, you add some behavior specs, written in a strongly typed DSL that even a stakeholder can understand. Testeranto will bundle and execute your test on it's custom multi-platform environment- that means it can run tests in the browser, as well as on the server-side- and the results of those tests, along with your source code, your documentation and your feature specifications are all gathered into a precisely tuned prompt, which you can load into the context of any LLM. With the press of a button, testeranto will launch that prompt, and auto-magically fix the broken tests.",
  "documentation": "Testeranto is more than a test platform- it's living documentation and a test reporter too. All the data that is fed into the LLM context is also used to build a static website, which is easily deployed to github pages. The puts the BDD specs, the test results and the test artifacts in 1 convenient package, allowing you to know the health of your codebase at a glance.",
  "cta": "Do you think that your project could benefit from testeranto. Then contact testeranto-dev@gmail.com to get put to the front of the list for our beta program and get free support for life."
