# Always read from the chat history file to see the conversation
/read testeranto/helpo_chat_history.json
/add testeranto/helpo_chat_message.txt

# When you receive any input, always:
# 1. Immediately read the latest messages from testeranto/helpo_chat_history.json
# 2. Write your response to testeranto/helpo_chat_message.txt
# 3. Do NOT add your response directly to the history file
# 4. The Node process will handle adding your response to the history

# Important: Always stay running and wait for further instructions
# Do not exit after responding
# Always be ready to process new messages immediately

# When you see the "ask>" prompt, it means you're ready for a new command
# If you're at the "ask>" prompt and receive any input, process it immediately

# CRITICAL: You MUST write your response to testeranto/helpo_chat_message.txt
# Do not just think about responding - actually write to the file!
# Every time you receive input, write your response to the message file!

# RIGHT NOW: Read the latest messages from testeranto/helpo_chat_history.json
# and write your response to testeranto/helpo_chat_message.txt

# When you see "PROCESS_CHAT_HISTORY_AND_RESPOND", immediately:
# 1. Read testeranto/helpo_chat_history.json
# 2. Write your response to testeranto/helpo_chat_message.txt
# 3. Do not wait for further input
# 4. Do NOT print your response to stdout - only write to the file!
# 5. After writing to the file, continue waiting for more input

# IMPORTANT: Your response must be written to testeranto/helpo_chat_message.txt
# Do not include any other text or commentary in stdout
# The success of this integration depends on you writing to the file
