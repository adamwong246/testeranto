### Hero/Jumbotron

#### Testeranto

##### The AI-powered BDD test framework for Typescript projects.

---

#### Vibe Coding meets

#### the Real World

##### You've heard the hype, but now it's time to get down to business. Harness the raw power of LLMs to write and test TypeScript at scale and soon you'l be vibing around your real-world codebase like a pro.

---

#### Tests so nice

#### they fix themselves

##### When a test fails, an LLM can fix the problem with the click of a button. It will also take care of static analysis problems, and informed by the documentation, it can even implement new features. Your might never have to write code again.

---

#### Perfectly

#### Precise

#### Prompts

##### Testeranto's prompts conserve the LLM's limited context. This means you can get better results from cheaper models. Testeranto fills your context so well, you can run a teeny-tiny model locally and avoid paying for api credits.

---

#### Test results,

#### artfully arranged

##### Track everything in git and you can see your test results, static analysis, features, documentation, and more in a lovely little static site that's easily deployed to GitHub Pages.

---

#### A new type of BDD

##### Behavior-Driven Design specifications are written in a tightly-typed TypeScript DSL that is so simple, even a stakeholder can understand it.

---

#### A demo is worth a thousand tokens.
