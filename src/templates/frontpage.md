### Hero/Jumbotron

#### Testeranto

##### The AI-powered BDD test framework for Typescript projects.

---

#### ✨ Vibe Coding Meets the Real World

##### You've seen the hype, but now it's time to get down to business. Harness the raw power of LLMs to write and test TypeScript at scale and soon you will be vibing around your real-world codebase like a pro.

---

#### 🤖 Tests so nice, they fix themselves

##### When a test fails, just press the auto-magical robot button and an LLM will fix it. It will also take care of static analysis problems, and informed by the features defined in your codebase, it can even implement new features. Your might never have to write code again.

---

#### 🧠 Perfectly Precise Prompts

##### Testeranto's prompts conserve the LLM's limited context. This means you can get better results from cheaper models. Testeranto fills your context so well, you can run a teeny-tiny model locally and avoid paying for api credits.

---

#### 📈 Test results, beautifully

##### Track everything in git and you can see your test results, static analysis, features, and more in a lovely little static site that's easily deployed to GitHub Pages.

---

#### 👨‍💼 A new type of BDD

##### Behavior-Driven Design specifications are written in a tightly-typed TypeScript DSL that is so simple, even a stakeholder can understand it.

---

#### A demo is worth a thousand words.
