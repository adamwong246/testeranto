comment: frontpage is a series of full-page sections which snap into place as the use scrolls down. The first and last slides have centered content.  The first is white text on background, the last slide is black text on white background. The rest alternate between left and right aligned, each with a different color sourced from our branding style.
slides:
  - Slide 0: Hero/Jumbotron. White text on black background
  - Slide 1: background gradient is black at top and the bottom is our coolest branding color.
  - Second to last slide: background gradient is our hottest branding color at top and white at bottom
  - Last slide: solid white background with black text.
  - all other slides have a background gradient sourced from our branding. These should be sorted (roughly) from dark and cool, to hot and white.

#### Testeranto

##### The AI-powered BDD test framework for Typescript projects.

---

#### Vibe Coding meets

#### the Real World

##### You've heard the hype, but now it's time to get down to business. Harness the raw power of LLMs to write and test TypeScript at scale and soon you will be vibing around your real-world codebase like a pro.

---

#### Tests so smart

#### they fix themselves

##### When a test fails, an LLM can auto-magically resolve it with the click of a button. It will also take care of type errors and static analysis issues, and informed by your own documentation, it can even implement new features. You might never write code again.

---

#### Perfectly

#### Precise

#### Prompts

##### Testeranto's prompts conserve the LLM's limited context, filling it with only the most pertinent source files, documentation and test results. This means you can get better results from cheaper models. Testeranto fills your context so well, you can run a OpenRouter model locally and avoid paying for api credits.

---

#### Test results,

#### artfully arranged

##### Are you tired of looking at ugly test reports? Track everything in git and you can see your test results, static analysis, type errors, screenshots, features, documentation, and more in a lovely little static site that's easily deployed to GitHub Pages.

---

#### Frontend, backend

#### and everything in between

##### You can run your tests in NodeV8, or Chrome, or both! Testeranto's custom multi-runtime allows you to run tests in the environment that's suitable for your code. You no longer need to hoist your React components with jest- you can render and test them right in the browser. You can even take screenshots with puppeteer!

---

#### A new type of BDD

##### Behavior-Driven Development specifications are written in a tightly-typed TypeScript DSL. You can edit those specs right in the browser with Github's Web VSCode editor, without ever cloning your project. It's so easy, even a stakeholder can do it.

---

#### Your repo made smarter with Aider.

##### Aider is a pair-programming chatbot that allows models to read and edit your local files. Testeranto uses Aider to execute it's prompts, but you can use Aider directly. Generate hundreds of lines of tested typescript, for mere pennies and in seconds.

---

#### A bundle of joy

##### Esbuild is a blazingly fast typescript bundler which is used to build testeranto's tests. It manages each test separately, so when you edit a file, only the tests which source that file are re-bundled and re-run. Add you own plugins to enhance esbuild's capabilities and you can bundle just about anything.

#### A demo is worth a thousand tokens.
