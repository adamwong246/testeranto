## Explainer Video Implementation

**Tech Stack:**
- `@revideo/2d` for declarative animations
- `@revideo/core` for timeline control
- React integration for easy embedding
- TypeScript for type safety

**Development Scripts:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install @revideo/2d @revideo/core

# Run video development server
npm run dev:video

# Render to MP4 (using revideo CLI)
npx revideo render ./src/components/ExplainerVideo.tsx -o explainer.mp4
```

**Animation Principles:**
1. **60fps smooth animations** using requestAnimationFrame
2. **Audio-synced visuals** via Revision's timeline
3. **Responsive design** works at any size
4. **Modular scenes** for easy updates
