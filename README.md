## What is testeranto?

- Testeranto produces test results which can be fed to Aider.ai to automatically fix failing tests.
- Testeranto tests are specified in a strongly-typed gherkin-like syntax. Rather than testing your code directly, Testeranto requires you wrap your code with a semantic interface which is based on TS type signatures.
- Testeranto can be run in the frontend or the backend, or both.
- Testeranto can be used to test anything that can be bundled with esbuild.

## tech of note

- esm - Testeranto uses modern js
- typescript - tests are functions with type parameters
- puppeteer - provides access to both node and chrome runtimes
- esbuild - used to quickly generate test bundles
- aider - AI to automatically fix broken tests

## Do's and Don't

When writing your test, be careful when using platform specific features, like "fs" on node, or "window" in the browser. If you need to write to a file, or to log information, use the `utils`. Instead of platform specific libraries, like node's "assert", use a cross-platform alternative like "chai".
