## What is testeranto?

- Testeranto.ts an AI-first, Acceptance Test Driven Development ([ATDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_test-driven_development)) framework for typescript projects.
- Testeranto produces test results which can be fed to Aider.ai to automatically fix failing tests.
- Testeranto tests are specified in a strongly-typed gherkin-like syntax. Rather than testing your code directly, Testeranto requires you wrap your code with a semantic interface which is based on TS type signatures.
- Testeranto can be run in the frontend or the backend, or both.
- Testeranto can be used to test anything that can be bundled with esbuild.
